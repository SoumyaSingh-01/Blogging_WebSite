# Thought Sharing App

The problem we are addressing is that people often have thoughts, ideas, and experiences that they want to share with others, but they lack a platform to do so. While there are social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, these platforms are often too cluttered and lack focus. There is a need for a platform that allows users to share their thoughts and experiences in a more structured and focused way.Our solution enables users to write down their ideas, publish them, and share them with a global audience. Additionally, it facilitates the classification of their posts based on the subject matter. Users can also browse through the posts created by other users.
